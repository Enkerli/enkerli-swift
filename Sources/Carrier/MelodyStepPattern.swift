//
//  Lines described as *moves* rather than as positions.
//
//  Everything else in this codebase is degree-relative: a note knows which step
//  of the sounding chord's scale it is. That already survives reharmonization.
//  But there's a level below it — describe a line as the sequence of *intervals
//  between* its notes and it survives something else: it can start anywhere, and
//  it doesn't need to know where it is at all.
//
//  Two traditions arrive at the same representation from opposite directions.
//
//  **Hanon.** *The Virtuoso Pianist* is built almost entirely on one device: a
//  short figure, repeated, each repetition starting one scale step higher. The
//  first exercise is C E F G A G F E, then D F G A B A G F, and so on up the
//  keyboard. Written as intervals between successive notes — including the step
//  from the end of one repetition into the start of the next — it is
//  `+2 +1 +1 +1 −1 −1 −1 −1`, and the sum of that cycle is **+1**.
//
//  That's the whole trick, and it falls out of this representation for free: *a
//  cycle of intervals whose sum isn't zero sequences itself.* Nothing has to
//  transpose anything. Play the loop and it climbs, because it ends one step
//  above where it began. A cycle summing to zero is an ornament that stays put;
//  one summing to −1 walks down. The `drift` property is that sum, and it is the
//  single most useful number about a cell.
//
//  **The Samchillian.** Leon Gruenbaum's Samchillian Tip Tip Tip Cheeepeeeee —
//  and the Misha, the Eventide module built from it with him — put this in the
//  performer's hands: the keys are intervals within the current scale, not
//  pitches, so the same fingering is the same *shape* in any key, and playing is
//  a matter of deciding where to go next rather than which note to hit. That is
//  precisely what a delta stream is, and it is why a vocabulary of cells here is
//  playable material rather than an exercise book: a Samchillian phrase and a
//  Hanon figure are the same kind of object.
//
//  What this buys MelGen specifically: contour that is genuinely independent of
//  register, of key, and of where the previous phrase left off — so a cell can be
//  dropped in anywhere, and a long line can be built by walking one rather than
//  by tiling a fixed shape. Tiling was what made the library repeat itself.
//
//  Deliberately free of any FoundationModels dependency.
//
