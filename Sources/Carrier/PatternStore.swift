//
//  PatternStore.swift
//  MelGenExtension
//
//  The library that outlives a session.
//
//  The take history lives in the host's saved state, which means it belongs to
//  one project in one host — reasonable for a log, wrong for a library. A line
//  you lifted from a take you liked should be there in the next session, in the
//  next host, over the next set of changes. So the derived patterns live here,
//  in the extension's own defaults, rather than in the document.
//
//  That's the cheap version of the split. The real one is an App Group container
//  shared with the host app and eventually with the siblings (ROADMAP I5/L4);
//  this at least puts the library on the right side of the line, so moving it
//  later is a change of storage rather than a change of meaning.
