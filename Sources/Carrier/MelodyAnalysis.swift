//  Measures a take, so curation has something to sort by.
//
//  Two questions, both asked of every take:
//
//  *How varied is it?* Temperature turned out not to be the variety lever — takes
//  come out ostinato-like even near 1.0 — so variety has to be measured rather
//  than dialled. Interval variety, rhythmic variety and self-similarity across
//  bars catch the three ways a line repeats itself.
//
//  *How does it sit on the harmony?* Every note is classified against the chord
//  under it: chord tone, colour tone, avoid note, or off-scale. Non-chord tones
//  aren't errors — they're most of what makes a line interesting — but they are
//  the thing worth *flagging for a human to judge*, which is what curation is.
//
//  Deliberately free of any FoundationModels dependency: it's arithmetic.
