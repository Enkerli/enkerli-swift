//
//  PatternSeeds.swift
//  MelGenExtension
//
//  The starting library of generic lines.
//
//  Each is written in scale degrees, so it fits any progression: degrees 0, 2, 4
//  and 6 are the chord tones of a seven-note scale, so landing on those on strong
//  beats is consonant whatever the chord turns out to be. Odd degrees are the
//  passing tones between them, and `alteration` buys a chromatic approach where a
//  line wants one.
//
//  These are meant to be *usable defaults*, not the whole vocabulary — the model
//  grows the library over time (ROADMAP G8/R1). They're hand-written because the
//  point is that something good is available instantly, with no model and no wait.
