//
//  MIDIFileExport.swift
//  MelGenExtension
//
//  A take as a `.mid` — ROADMAP X1, with X3's chord information included
//  rather than deferred.
//
//  Export and import are one feature, not two, and writing them apart is how
//  interchange formats rot. Everything `MIDIFileImport` knows how to read is
//  written here: per-chord markers a DAW displays, and the same
//  `MCURATOR:v1 PROG` payload the suite's `leadsheet-smf.ts` writes, so a take
//  that leaves MelGen and comes back arrives with its changes intact — and so
//  does one that goes to MIDIcurator instead.
//
//  What is deliberately *not* written: a track of block chords. The suite's
//  exporter includes one because its files are progressions; MelGen's are
//  lines, and a second track of comping nobody asked to hear is a surprise in
//  someone else's session. The harmony rides as metadata, where it can be read
//  without being played.
//
//  Deliberately free of any FoundationModels dependency.
