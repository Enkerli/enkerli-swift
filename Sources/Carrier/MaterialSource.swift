//  MaterialSource.swift
//  MelGenExtension
//
//  The six ways to get material, as one list with the two facts that matter.
//
//  From the redesign's second rule: *cost is the axis*. Thirteen buttons had
//  accumulated across three sections, organised by the order they were built in,
//  and what a person actually chooses between is where the material comes from
//  and whether it answers now or in about half a minute. Neither was written
//  anywhere. Both are properties of the source, so they live on it.
//
//  The list is filtered by mode rather than duplicated, which is the fourth
//  rule: choosing Chords has to change what the sources *are*, not just what one
//  button does. Three of the six can produce a voicing; the rest are melodic by
//  construction, and offering them under Chords would be offering something the
//  mode can't deliver.
//
//  That filter used to live here, as `all(for: PlayMode)`, which made a carrier
//  type name a MelGen mode — PORTING.md's `MaterialSource → PlayMode` seam. It
//  is now `PlayMode.sources`, beside the mode it is about. A sibling plug-in
//  gets the list and supplies its own answer to "which of these can I use",
//  which is the only part that was ever MelGen's.
