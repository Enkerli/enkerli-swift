//  MIDIFileImport.swift
//  MelGenExtension
//
//  What a `.mid` file *means* — the half `StandardMIDIFile` deliberately leaves
//  alone. ROADMAP S2's in-app reader and X4, and the reason MelGen and
//  MIDIcurator can now hand each other a file.
//
//  The whole difficulty is harmony. A pattern in this app is a run of scale
//  degrees relative to whatever chord is sounding, and that is what makes a
//  line reusable over other changes. A MIDI file is pitches. So the question
//  every import has to answer first is *where do the chords come from*, and the
//  answer has four tiers, in descending order of how much they can be trusted:
//
//  1. **An embedded progression.** A file written by the suite carries the
//     whole leadsheet as an `MCURATOR:v1 PROG` text meta event — the format
//     `packages/midi/leadsheet-smf.ts` writes, and the one MIDIcurator and
//     ProgGenie already speak. Lossless, because a machine wrote it for this.
//  2. **Chord-symbol markers.** Positioned text a human or an exporter left.
//     Common in files from notation software, and it is also the belt to tier
//     one's braces: the suite's exporter writes a marker per chord, so a
//     progression authored in Roman numerals still arrives as absolute symbols
//     here even when the payload can't be read as text.
//  3. **A chord track.** Real harmony, but as pitches, so it goes through
//     `ChordDetection`. Block voicings read correctly; an *arpeggiated* chord
//     track comes out as a run of wrong triads, which is why it is last and why
//     the import says so.
//  4. **Nothing.** The file still reads. It just can't contribute degrees —
//     only rhythm and contour — and that is stated rather than guessed at.
//
//  The tiers are the same ones `Scripts/training/midi_to_events.py` uses on the
//  desktop, minus its `<stem>.chords` sidecar (a document picker hands over one
//  file, not a directory) and plus tier one, which the Python doesn't read yet.
//
//  Deliberately free of any FoundationModels dependency.
//
