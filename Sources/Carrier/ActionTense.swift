//  What happens when you press it, of three, and there is no fourth.
//
//  The design pass before this one split controls by *when they take effect* —
//  now, or next take. That was half a grammar, and the missing half is the one
//  the brief was actually about: **making a take is not "next", it is its own
//  act**, with its own cost, its own gesture, and — until this change — no
//  manual control anywhere in the interface. Auto pressed a button that did not
//  exist.
//
//  So every action answers exactly one of three questions:
//
//  · **now** — changes what you are hearing. Free, reversible, audible this lap.
//  · **take** — makes something judgeable. Costs between nothing and two
//    minutes, arrives on a lap boundary, enters the history, can be rated.
//  · **aims** — changes what the next one will be like. Silent until a verb.
//
//  The test, for any control: press it with the transport running and say what
//  happened. *The sound changed* → `now`. *Something arrived that I could rate*
//  → `take`. *Nothing, yet* → `aims`.
//
//  This is a type rather than a convention because the previous pass stated the
//  same distinction as a convention in a comment, and a convention that isn't
//  checkable is one that comes back. ISSUES §6.5 — "changes" retired in a commit
//  message, never written down, back in a dozen strings five days later — is the
//  same lesson arriving from a different direction, and the reason
//  `verify.sh terminology` now scans these labels.
//
//  Deliberately free of SwiftUI, so `verify.sh` can reach it, and of any
//  FoundationModels dependency.
//
