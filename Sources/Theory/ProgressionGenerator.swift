//
//  Generating the changes, not just the line.
//
//  Ported from ProgGenie (music-suite/packages/proggen), tables and all. The
//  method is a variable-order walk over corpus transition counts between
//  Roman-numeral labels: what follows "IIm7", blended with what follows
//  "IIm7 → V7", backing off to the first order when the second is sparse.
//
//  That is the same machinery as MelodyChain.swift one level up, and the
//  resemblance is worth noticing rather than tidying away: a progression is a
//  sequence of symbols with strong local dependencies and weak long ones, and so
//  is a melody. Both want order-2 where the corpus supports it and order-1
//  everywhere else; both are ruined by trusting a context seen once.
//
//  What this is *for* here is the thing the whole project is exploring: generate
//  the changes, adapt patterns to them, curate the results, without leaving the
//  environment. Until now a progression arrived by being typed or pasted, which
//  meant every experiment started with a trip to another application.
//
//  Realization goes through MelGen's own chord dictionary rather than a second
//  copy of the theory: a label becomes a numeral and a suffix, the numeral
//  becomes a pitch class in the chosen key, and the pair becomes leadsheet text
//  that `ChordProgression.parse` reads back. Anything the dictionary can't parse
//  is skipped rather than emitted, so a generated progression is always one the
//  rest of the plug-in can actually play.
//
//  Deliberately free of any FoundationModels dependency.
