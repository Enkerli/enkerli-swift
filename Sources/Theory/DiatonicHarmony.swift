//  MelGenExtension
//
//  A key, where the rest of the plug-in expects changes.
//
//  MelGen has always started from a progression, because that is what a
//  leadsheet is and because degree-relative material only means anything against
//  a chord. Plenty of music doesn't work that way. A modal vamp, a bass line
//  over a one-chord groove, most of what a step sequencer is for — these have a
//  key and a colour and no changes at all, and asking someone to type a chord
//  symbol to get one is asking them to answer a question they weren't posing.
//
//  So: a key and a *minorness* become a progression of exactly one chord that
//  lasts the whole form. Nothing downstream changes. The pattern format still
//  describes degrees, the histograms still read against a `DegreeContext`, the
//  kernel still loops a take. What's different is only that the harmony has one
//  member and the interface asks for it in two dials rather than in text.
//
//  ## The ladder
//
//  Minorness is a position on the modal brightness ladder, not a switch between
//  major and minor. The seven modes of the major scale sort into exactly one
//  order by how many notes they flatten, and each step down flattens exactly one
//  degree:
//
//      Lydian ──♯4→4── Ionian ──7→♭7── Mixolydian ──3→♭3── Dorian
//             ──6→♭6── Aeolian ──2→♭2── Phrygian ──5→♭5── Locrian
//
//  That is a continuum, it is the one every modal instrument's "brightness" knob
//  is secretly implementing, and it is the honest way to make "how minor is
//  this" a single control. At 0 the line is as bright as diatonic material gets;
//  at 1 it is as dark. Halfway is Dorian, which is where most of the music that
//  needs this dial actually lives.
//
//  A scale can't be fractional — the harmony has to commit — so the *chord* uses
//  the nearest rung while the *degree histogram* blends its two neighbours. That
//  is a real difference and it is audible: between Mixolydian and Dorian both
//  thirds carry weight, and the one the scale doesn't contain arrives as an
//  altered degree with its role recorded, which is exactly what the pattern
//  format was built to carry.
//
//  Deliberately free of any FoundationModels dependency.
//
