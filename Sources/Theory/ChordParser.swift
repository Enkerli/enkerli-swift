//
//  ChordParser.swift
//  MelGenExtension
//
//  Parses chord progressions written in simple leadsheet format,
//  e.g. "E♭7 Gm9|D∆|A♭6" — bars separated by "|", chords by spaces.
//
//  Chord qualities come from the shared chord dictionary (ChordDictionary),
//  and each chord's scale, tensions and avoid notes from ChordScales, so MelGen
//  agrees with the rest of the suite on what a symbol means.
