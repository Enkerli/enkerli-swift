//
//  The layer between a chord's pitch classes and something a keyboard would play.
//
//  The shared dictionary says which pitch classes a chord contains. That is not a
//  voicing, and the gap between the two is most of what makes comping sound like
//  comping: register, spacing, which tones are left out, which are doubled,
//  whether the bass is there at all, and — above everything — how one voicing
//  moves to the next.
//
//  Two decisions worth stating.
//
//  *Tones are classified by interval, not by position in a list.* It would be
//  shorter to say "the second entry is the third", and it would break on every
//  suspended, quartal and altered chord in the dictionary, which is a large
//  fraction of the interesting ones. Asking "which of these is three or four
//  semitones above the root" costs nothing and is right everywhere.
//
//  *Voice leading is the point, not a refinement.* A sequence of individually
//  good voicings played in sequence sounds like a chord chart being read aloud.
//  What makes it sound played is that the notes barely move — common tones held,
//  everything else going to its nearest neighbour — so the voicings here are
//  generated as a *sequence* by default and the single-chord call is the special
//  case rather than the other way round.
//
//  This is the layer ROADMAP I1 wants shared with the rest of the suite; it's
//  written to be portable and depends on nothing but the chord dictionary.
//
//  Deliberately free of any FoundationModels dependency.
