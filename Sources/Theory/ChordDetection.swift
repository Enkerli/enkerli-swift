//
//  ChordDetection.swift
//  MelGenExtension
//
//  Naming a chord from the notes that are sounding — ROADMAP I6, ported from
//  MIDIcurator by way of music-suite's `chordDetect.ts`.
//
//  MelGen has always been able to go from a *name* to pitches. This is the
//  other direction, and it is what an imported MIDI file needs: a chord track
//  is real harmony written as pitches, and without this the file can only teach
//  rhythm and contour. A degree with no chord under it is a pitch with a story
//  attached.
//
//  The algorithm is the suite's, unchanged, because the whole value of a port
//  is that both sides answer the same question the same way:
//
//    1. Reduce to unique pitch classes.
//    2. For each of the twelve possible roots, rotate so that root is 0.
//    3. Read the rotated set as a 12-bit fingerprint and look it up.
//    4. Prefer an exact match; failing that, allow the input to carry extra
//       notes and match the largest quality that explains the most of them.
//    5. Break ties by fewer extra notes, then simpler quality, then lower root.
//
//  Two deliberate differences from the TypeScript, both about staying
//  consistent with the rest of *this* app rather than with the suite's display:
//
//  **Symbols are spelled the way `ChordParser` writes them** — flat names and
//  `ChordDictionary.displaySuffix` — so a detected chord can be handed straight
//  back to `ChordProgression.parse`. Agreeing with the suite's symbol strings
//  would mean disagreeing with every other chord name MelGen shows. Root and
//  quality agree exactly, and that is what the cross-language vectors check.
//
//  **Ties are broken by dictionary order rather than by a stable sort.**
//  JavaScript's `Array.sort` is stable and Swift's is not, so the insertion
//  index is carried and compared last. Same answer, on purpose, rather than by
//  luck — this is the same class of bug as the non-total comparator that once
//  made `MelodyVariants.explore` return a different order on different runs.
//
//  Deliberately free of any FoundationModels dependency: it is arithmetic.
//
