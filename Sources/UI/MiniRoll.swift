//
//  The take, in 44 points, in the bar that never scrolls.
//
//  The action grammar pinned rate, roll and advance — and then the thing they
//  act on scrolled away, so the bar was a set of buttons with no object. This is
//  the object. Once it is there the bar stops being a toolbar and becomes the
//  instrument, which is the permission the layout pass needed to take anything
//  away at all.
//
//  **Not a small piano roll.** A different drawing with a different job, and the
//  distinction is the whole design: `PianoRoll` answers *which note is that, and
//  does it belong* — it needs rows, scale shading, roles, a legend. This answers
//  *where am I, what is the shape, is it dense or sparse*, and nothing it draws
//  needs explaining. Shrinking the full roll to 44pt would have produced a
//  thing that looked like it could be read and couldn't.
//
//  So: register becomes height rather than a row, notes become marks rather than
//  bars, the scale shading goes entirely, and the only colour that survives is
//  the one that means *look at this* — a note the analyser flagged for review.
//  Chord names stay, because "where am I" is mostly a harmonic question.
//
//  It is also the swipe target, which the full roll used to be. That follows
//  from it being the thing on screen: you rate what you can see.
