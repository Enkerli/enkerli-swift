//
//  ActionBadge.swift
//  MelGenExtension
//
//  Three words, on group headers, saying what pressing anything inside will do.
//
//  One badge per group and two on the verbs — five on screen at rest. A badge
//  per control was the obvious first draft and is noise: it makes the rule look
//  like decoration, and a rule that looks decorative is one nobody reads. The
//  exception is the single case where two tenses genuinely sit side by side,
//  where the badge is the entire reason the split exists.
//
//  No new tokens. The three pairings are ones the audit already covers —
//  `accentText` on `accent`, `text` on `raised`, `textMuted` on `sunken` — and
//  if one of them ever fails `Scripts/verify.sh contrast`, the badge changes
//  rather than the theme.
//
//  **No border, on any of them**, and that is the layout pass correcting the
//  grammar pass. `MelGenTheme` defines `borderStrong` as "boundaries that
//  identify a control", so putting one on a `take` badge — which is a label
//  nobody can press — spends the one signal that distinguishes a control from
//  everything else on something that isn't one. The three already differ by
//  surface, which is what the theme's three surfaces are for: `accent`,
//  `raised`, `sunken`. The border was redundant before it was wrong.
