//
//  RateAndAdvance.swift
//  MelGenExtension
//
//  The verb bar: the three things done per minute, in a strip that never scrolls.
//
//  Kept in its own file for the same reason `MelGenPanelParts.swift` is: these
//  views exist to keep one rule true — *the coarse layer never reaches storage*
//  — and a rule is easier to keep when the code that implements it is somewhere
//  you can read in one sitting. Nothing here writes a mark itself; everything
//  goes through `MelGenState.rate` and lands as one of the seven.
//
//  Two decisions worth stating because they look like mistakes:
//
//  *Yes is wider than No and Maybe.* It is not the good one and they are not the
//  bad ones — weight and colour stay equal across all three. Only width differs,
//  because Yes is the answer whose consequence is durable, and target size is
//  how an interface says which tap you cannot afford to fat-finger. Wider by a
//  *minimum width*, though: the whole argument is about targets, so the two that
//  are not Yes still have to clear 44pt at every window size.
//
//  *The advance buttons are filled by which one the swipe will use*, not by
//  which is better. Tapping either both advances and makes it the swipe's mode,
//  so the words under the strip are always true.
//
//  *The aim is a switch, not a third button.* There were two aims and two
//  buttons; there are three aims now and no room for three in a pinned bar. So
//  `Next take` is one verb whose subtitle says which aim is loaded and what it
//  will produce, and `AimSwitch` beside it cycles the three. Two shipped buttons
//  becoming one verb with an aim is what makes room for the third — and the
//  subtitle is what stops a switch being a mystery, because the button always
//  reads as a sentence about what is about to happen.
